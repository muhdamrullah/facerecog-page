                <h3>#DBSRethinkRetail</h3>
                <p>In Asian culture, it is believed that guests should always be treated with heart and mind. The culture of treating guests well defines you as a business. When the experience of a guest becomes very personal, guests feel at ease to do business.</p>
                <p>DBS rolled up their sleeves and took a chance with deep new technology at their concept store at Sports Hub. To launch this store, DBS took our proprietary <font color="gold">trigger advertising</font> concept to the next level. Everytime a customer walks into the branch, the screens will learn about every customer before recommending the most relevant suite of products.</p>
                <p>"The retail branch is essentially a living store - that learns about its customers before transforming itself into your personal banker". No wonder people love banking at DBS.</p>

                <h2>#UnileverActiveResearch</h2>
                <p>With Facerecog newly appointed as Unilever's tech partner for their work in qualitative research, we were briefed to help their researchers gather more insights for focus groups in a new way - <font color="gold">facial expression detection</font>.</p>
                <p>The facial expression detector harnesses the power of computers to help researchers do their work better. Developed in partnership with Quantum Research, the facial expression detector combines the best machine learning technology with the best researchers in the world to deliver the best in class in computer-aided qualitative research.</p>
                <p>"Qualitative research is now more reliable" - This core idea that qualitative researchers can rely on machines to tell them what their focus group participants are feeling is amazing. We are redefining the future of qualitative research. With this technology, Unilever can do more with less.</p>
                <p>Facerecog won  <font color="gold">GOLD</font> award in the ASEAN ICT AWARDS Telmin in 2015 for its work with Unilever.</p>

                <p>SMRT and Facerecog are on a mission to combine e-commerce with facial recognition, and engage commuters to purchase items while taking the MRT.</p>
                <p>Not convinced that people will have the time to purchase items as they board the MRT, we decided to personalise the items that are shown to commuters using our <font color="gold">age and gender detection</font>. A QR code is then shown for the commuters to purchase instantly via their mobile phones.</p>
                <p>"Shopping while commuting" was brought to life through a pilot that took place at City Hall MRT station. Over 200,000 commuters pass by City Hall everyday so the potential to engage commuters is immense. If a dollar worth of products are sold to each commuter, sellers can earn as much as $200,000 a day.</p>
